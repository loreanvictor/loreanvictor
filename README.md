I am Eugene Ghanizadeh Khoub, I study informatics at [TUM](https://www.tum.de/en/), have helped out [@CafeBazaar](https://github.com/cafebazaar), [@CONNECT-platform](https://github.com/CONNECT-platform), and [@coding.blog](https://github.com/Coding-blog) and worked on [**CODEDOC**](https://github.com/CONNECT-platform/codedoc). Currently I work with [@ECOMPLY](https://github.com/ecomply) on data protection, help [@Divar](https://github.com/divar-ir) with product management, and try to see what comes out of [@Vitrine](https://github.com/vitrin-app).

üëâ Here are the other (coding) stuff that (currently) interest me (and so I am working on):

## ‚ö° Reactive Programming

- [quel](https://github.com/loreanvictor/quel): imperative reactive programming
- [streamlets](https://github.com/loreanvictor/streamlet): a protocol for handling data/event streams (its like callbags but marginally faster and pausable by default).
- [callbag-common](https://github.com/loreanvictor/callbag-common): a hand-picked and patched collection of callbag utilities
- [callbag-state](https://github.com/loreanvictor/callbag-state) and [callbag-state-keyed](https://github.com/loreanvictor/callbag-state-keyed): as-easy-as-it-gets and versatile state management using callbags
