Hi, I am Eugene Ghanizadeh Khoub. I study informatics at [TUM](https://www.tum.de/en/), have worked in different positions in [@cafebazaar](https://github.com/cafebazaar), and am currently work with [@CONNECT-platform](https://github.com/CONNECT-platform) on [**CODEDOC**](https://github.com/CONNECT-platform/codedoc) and [coding.blog](https://github.com/CONNECT-platform/coding-blog), and with [@ecomply](https://github.com/ecomply) on data protection.

Here are the other (coding) stuff that (currently) interest me (and so I am working on):

## Reactive Programming

Specifically, [RxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs) and more recently, [Callbags](https://github.com/callbag/callbag). Here are the stuff I work on in this area:

- [callbag-common](https://github.com/loreanvictor/callbag-common): a hand-picked and patched collection of callbag utilities
- [callbag-expr](https://github.com/loreanvictor/callbag-expr): easy expressions with callbags
- [callbag-state](https://github.com/loreanvictor/callbag-state) and [callbag-state-keyed](https://github.com/loreanvictor/callbag-state-keyed): as-easy-as-it-gets and versatile state management using callbags
- [rxdeep](https://github.com/loreanvictor/rxdeep): same thing but for RxJS

## Frontend Libraries

I love the idea of utilizing JSX with explicit reactive programming (so no VDOM, better performance, etc.). Stuff that I work on on this front:

- [render-jx](https://github.com/loreanvictor/render-jsx): a set of tools for building JSX libraries
- [callbag-jsx](https://github.com/loreanvictor/callbag-jsx): JSX + callbags, tiny performant explicitly reactive frontend library

## Backend Tooling

- [TyFON](https://github.com/loreanvictor/tyfon): a zero-config TypeScript RPC
- [RxXpress](https://github.com/loreanvictor/rxxpress): an experimental mashup of RxJS and Express

## Other

- [KƒÅshi](https://github.com/loreanvictor/kaashi): a turing-complete json-like language
- [My Blog](https://eugene.coding.blog): which I sometimes update with some new stuff
- [Also I write stuff on Dev.to](https://dev.to/loreanvictor)
