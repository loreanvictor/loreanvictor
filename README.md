Hi

I am Eugene Ghanizadeh Khoub. I have been working in IT industry for about 9 - 10 years now. Mainly I have worked in different positions (some actually non-dev related) in [@cafebazaar](https://github.com/cafebazaar) for a few years. Now I am working with [@CONNECT-platform](https://github.com/CONNECT-platform) on [**CODEDOC**](https://github.com/CONNECT-platform/codedoc) and [coding.blog](https://github.com/CONNECT-platform/coding-blog), and with [@ecomply](https://github.com/ecomply) on data protection, all in Munich, Germany. And I am also studying at [TUM](https://www.tum.de/en/).

Alongside these _a bit more serious_ endeavours, I am also working on a variety of other open-source projects, mainly focused on exploring further usage of Reactive Programming (specifically [RxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs)) in all facets of (web) programming (frontend and backend). For backend, the exploration has resulted in [RxXpress](https://github.com/loreanvictor/rxxpress), and for frontend, I believe JSX + RxJS should be enough for creating a super-thin and super-performant frontend library without the need for VirtualDOM or dirty model checking (or any other equivalent trickery). That exploration has resulted in [CONNECTIVE-HTML](https://github.com/CONNECT-platform/connective-html) and its related family of libraries (such as [CONNECTIVE-SDH](https://github.com/CONNECT-platform/connective-sdh), which also power [**CODEDOC**](https://github.com/CONNECT-platform/codedoc). I am now working towards an even thinner and more optimized version of those libraries and tools, starting with the super light-weight and efficient state-management library [RxDeep](https://github.com/loreanvictor/rxdeep).

And yes I am also working on [KƒÅshi](https://github.com/loreanvictor/kaashi), which is a turing complete json-like language (I guess ideal for complex configuration and data-processing). This project has started many years ago in [@cafebazaar](https://github.com/cafebazaar) actually as a UI language, but have revived it recently.

As mentioned in the bio, lots of crazy ideas.
